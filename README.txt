Notice
======

This source code was taken from a live website (http://axiom.apertus.org/index.php?site=donate) 
then cleaned up and had all credentials removed.
So the resulting code was not tested to be functional on an actual website.

Installation
============

MYSQL Database structure:
install the database by running the SQL query in MYSQL-DB.sql


I know its cumbersome but currently the MYSQL DB connection details 
have to be manually added in most PHP source files. Maybe someone can streamline that as contribution.
